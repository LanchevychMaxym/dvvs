"Skyfall"
Let the sky fall.
When it crumbles
We will stand tall,
Face it all together.
At Skyfall.
Skyfall is where we start…
A thousand miles and poles apart,
When worlds collide, and days are dark…
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you’ll never have my heart.
Let the sky fall.
When it crumbles
We will stand tall,
Face it all together.
Let the sky fall.
When it crumbles
We will stand tall,
Face it all together.

Adele "SkyFall"
